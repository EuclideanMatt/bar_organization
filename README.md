# Dram Organization Project #

This project focuses on organizing and cleaning the category and item features in a dataset related to "Dram" items. The notebook guides through the process of restructuring the data, starting with the most recent datasets, to prepare it for statistical analysis and visualization.

# Project Overview # 

The primary objective of this project is to clean and organize the noisy category and item features in the dataset. The focus is on using the latest available data, as it contains the most comprehensive and up-to-date sales information. By cleaning and restructuring the data, the project aims to enhance the quality and accuracy of subsequent statistical analyses and visualizations. 

Features category and item are both noisy and messy and require some cleaning. By conducting this cleaning it will be possible to identify items in a hierachical fashion. A few examples include... Type: Beer - Category: IPA, Type: Red Wine - Category: Red Blend.

This was accomplished with dictionary manipluation 

# Goals # 

The goals of this project are:

Successfully Clean and Restructure Data: Ensure that the data is properly organized from its raw state to support statistical methods and visualizations.
Develop Consistent Data Organization Methods: Create a consistent approach to handling the category and item features across multiple datasets.

# Data Cleaning and Restructuring #

The data cleaning process involves several steps, including:

* Standardizing Feature Names: Convert all feature names to lowercase and remove spaces for consistency.
* Cleaning Monetary Values: Remove any extraneous characters (e.g., $ and -) from monetary features.
* Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Remove columns that are irrelevant to the analysis to streamline the dataset
